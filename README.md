# Hacker News App

## Overview

React-JS Application that enables you to read as well as search up a list of news articles,
this Application is supposed to be some semblance of the TheHackerNews.com website.

## How the Application Works

When the Application initially loads up you would get a list of headline articles and a list of trending news articles
displayed on the user interface which you would be able to click on, after which point you'd be redirected to a new tab
with the article that you clicked on. You can also click on the search icon at the top right of the corner
to toggle a search bar that will enable you to search for news topics you'd like to look up.  


## Technologies Used

JSX, CSS, Bulma CSS, Javascript, React-JS, and the Axios Library.

## How to get the Application Started

You want to clone the app onto your local machine, after cloning you want to enter the directory that contains all of the
project files and run npm install in-order to install all the dependencies that the project relies upon. Once the dependencies
are fully installed then you want to run npm start in-order to open up the application.
